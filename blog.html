                <h1>Magnets and magnetic field</h1>
                <p class="p1">Magnets are bodies that create a magnetic field and attract objects
                    of iron and other ferromagnetic materials.
                    Magnetic field - we are in it. Are you sure you want an explanation?
                    Each planet in the solar system has its own magnetic field.
                    We are actually in the Earth's magnetosphere. Namely, the magnetic envelope
                    i.e. the magnetosphere is the area of ​​space around the planet, which it controls
                    the magnetic field of the planet Earth.<br> Our planet acts with magnetic force
                    how to plant
                   and the animal world as well as us humans.
                    Without the magnetic field, we would not exist. Let's have a look
                     what is actually behind it.
                     the latest studies published on this topic clearly prove that people
                     and also other creatures can sense the magnetic field.<br>
                     It seems that certain bacteria, snails, frogs (on which
                     carry out various experiments on the subject of magnets and magnetic fields)
                     and hawks discover the earth's magnetic field. Everything becomes a lot
                     more interesting when there is information that some animals
                     like migratory birds even rely on it.</p><br><br><br>
                
                  <h1>Magnetic field measurement unit</h1>
                  <p class="p1"> The unit of measurement of magnetic induction is Gauss, symbol G (sometimes Gs),
                    is also known as the magnetic flux density. One gauss is defined as one
                    maxwell per square centimeter. The unit is part of the Gaussian system of units,
                     which inherited it from the older CGS-EMU system. It was named after
                      to the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friendrich Gauss in 1936.
                      There is another unit for measuring the magnetic field.
                       It's a Tesla and it's 10000G.
                       Unfortunately, it has been scientifically proven that the magnetic field weakens over time.
                       This phenomenon is indirectly reflected on every living organism on the planet.
                       Only 500 years ago, the strength of the magnetic field in our country was 1 Gauss per
                       cm2 and now it is half as much.</p>

        <h1>The strength of the earth's magnetic field</h1>
        <p class="p1">The Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing, and so is the way it changes.
            When describing the Earth's magnetic field, we must determine both the direction and intensity of the field.
            Since both change and change differently in different places, it is not easy to say how
            it changes the earth's field as a whole. Due to the complexity of the Earth's magnetic field and
             constant changes, it is impossible to predict what the field will be like in the future.<br>
             Depending on the geographical latitude, the strength of the earth's magnetic field varies.
             It is strongest around the poles and weakest in Ecuador.<br>
             The field strength on the Earth's surface ranges from less than 30 microtesla (0.3 Gauss)
             in an area that includes most of South America and South Africa to over 60 microtesla
             (0.6 Gauss) around the magnetic poles in northern Canada and southern Australia, and in part of Siberia.<br>
             In our area, a magnetic field of half a gauss passes through each of us. </p><br><br><br>
          <h1>The Magic Circles of Najdan</h1>
          <p class="p1">There are places on the planet that are known to have a beneficial effect on health.
            Strong magnetic fields were measured in those places. One of them is Naidan's circles
             Mali Krsna on the territory of the municipality of Smederevo. <br>
             Namely, in 1999, radiologist Najdan Rakić found a place in the shape of a circle with a diameter of 7m.
             Because of its healing effect, Mala Krsna is now also called Suva Banja. There are records that indicate
             to the fact that people were treated in the same place in 1713. Science does not yet have an answer to this phenomenon
             while radioestheticians claim that it is a place with strong positive radiation.<br>
             It is a natural phenomenon that requires more research. It was confirmed that there are absolutely no bad ones
             torture for man.<br>
             One of the wisdom is to come to places like this and expose yourself to what God and nature have given.</p>
